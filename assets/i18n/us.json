This product aimed to virtualize expensive solutions, providing the same functionality at a much more affordable price. To accomplish this work, I utilized technologies such as Java, Python, Cloud Foundry, Jenkins, Angular, and Kafka. <br /> Within the context of this project, system creation involved designing and implementing applications and platforms that allowed users to access and utilize connectivity resources efficiently and cost-effectively. Additionally, I developed custom dashboards that provided a comprehensive view of system performance and availability, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues. I also implemented alarms and monitoring mechanisms to alert the team in real-time of any failures or anomalies, ensuring a prompt and effective response. <br /> This experience allowed me to gain deep knowledge of the utilized technologies, such as Java, Python, Cloud Foundry, Jenkins, Angular, and Kafka. Furthermore, I honed my skills in integrating different software components, ensuring a cohesive and scalable solution. Through the use of these technologies, I was able to contribute to the success of the project by offering an innovative and affordable solution in the connectivity market."
